	// 			  (2) that we have not tried to excavate location A
	//			  (3) that the maximum number of excavation attempts has not been reached
	// * An update with probability ex_locA (excavatability of excavation location A) that:
	//			  (1) updates the variable saying that we have tried location A (not needed but left for clarity)
	// 			  (2) updates the variable that keeps track of excavation attempts
	//			  (3) updates the arm location variable to location A
	//            (4) updates the variable for excavation success in the current location to true	
	// * Another update with probability 1-ex_locA that:
	//			  (1) updates the variable saying that we have tried location A
	//			  (2) updates the arm location variable to location A (even if we have not succeeded excavating)
	// 			  (3) updates the variable that keeps track of excavation attempts
	// Command 2:
	// * A guard that checks: (1) that there is success in the current excavation location
	// * An update that: (1) sets the excavation success back to false
   	//			         (2) updates the state to successful excavation (DONE_EXCAVATING)
